# Antonio's Pizza

Antonio's Pizza is a single scrolling page website that depicts the authentic method of baking pizza in Napoletano's original style. An old 18th-century building in the heart of Uppsala.

Users of this website will quickly and easily find the menu well sorted with ingredients and price. Visitors also get to see a glimpse of what the food looks like. You can also read a little about them. A map and contact details are also available so that visitors can find their way there on their own or call/email if they have any questions.
